<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Thoughts on Kira's interview:</strong>&nbsp;Kira uses multiple fashion/clothing related apps. She&rsquo;s experienced in online shopping and like most people, wonder what it would look like on a &ldquo;normal person&rdquo; versus a model. Potentially being open to the ability to try on clothing with their camera, that allows them to see what the piece of clothing or outfit may look like on them. Kira is open to joining a beta once it is available. This is my first interview, so I will give an overall take on all of my user interviews once I have completed them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thoughts on Cherish's interview:</strong> Cherish doesn't use fashion/clothing apps but does find themselves purchasing clothes online often. Although she prefers to wear baggy clothing, so if something may not be accurate to size, it may not be an issue for them. Like other users, there are concerns of variety in clothing models photos. Often times, the models for the clothing aren't an average depiction of the average buyer. They would be opening to use an app to "try on clothes" and would be willing to sign up for our beta. I notice that knowing if the fit would be right on the user is an issue we likely cannot combat given our current and likely future features, this is something users want to know. Potentially, if this goes anywhere, we could possibly give the ability for stores to add their products to our app or even implement it, in their sites. Giving accurate proportions of the images we either mold to the user or "Resize". Potentially with the ability for users to pass in their measurements in a filter and find clothing that fits those measurements, even being able to be as specific as down to leg, hip, bust, and other measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Jacob's interview:</strong> Jacob doesn't use any fashion/clothing apps. That being said, Jacob does purchase clothes online. It is unsure how often compared to conventional clothe shopping. Jacob seems to care more about the quality of a piece of clothing, moreso than how it may look or fit. Although fit is clearly a concern, especially if it will fit normal sizes well. Jacob has concerns with clothing not having enough reviews or information on how a product feels and the level of quality a product may be of. Jacob is open to joining a beta program for the app, although somebody like Jacob seems like less of a fit for our targeted demographic.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Allison's interview:&nbsp;</strong>Allison is a person in their mid-20s, they have used clothing/fashion related apps in the past but don't use them very often. Like many other, Allison shops for clothing online and usually has a good experience with that. One issue that seems to be a recurring one, is that Allison also wants to know what the item of clothing would like on themselves before they purchase it. Unlike Jacob, Allison has had luck with finding reviews on clothing which has helped them have less of a hard time finding clothing that is not worth the purchase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thoughts on Marisa's interview:</strong> Like Jamie, Marisa is not a clear targeted demographic. Although she has online shopped, she prefers to do so in person due to personal reasons. Bringing in a new perspective that I have not thought about, Marisa is suspicious of allowing an app to be granted permissions to use her camera or access her photos due to privacy concerns. Marisa was not open to using an app of this kind and was not open to testing a beta.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Lex's interview:</strong>Lex uses fashion/shopping related apps and has an overall good experience with them. One feature she brought up was the ability to save items into a "Wishlist". If we were to later team up with other companies to sell their products through our app, this would likely be a good feature to have, as somebody may not always be looking to make a purchase immediately, but still want the item at a later date. Like most users though, Lex is comfortable with trying out a new app that may make shopping or looking for new outfits easier.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Dominique's interview:</strong>Dominique uses fashion/clothing shopping apps frequently. Out of all of our current interviewees, Dominique uses them the most often as Dominique stated "Every payday". Dominique wishes these apps had better sorting and filtering features. Dominique doesn't think they need an app to try on clothings since Dominique has a fairly easy time finding clothes that fits them, which would mean our app would not be currently targeted towards somebody like Dominique.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Melissa's interview:</strong>Melissa uses fashion apps regularly. Twice as week or so, which shows that she is quite active. This would make her an ideal target for our app. Her biggest concern is the sizing options offered by different sites. Being able to see if these pieces of clothings will fit, is her biggest concern. She would be open to an app which would allow her to try on clothign to see if it would be the proper size or look good.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Katherine's interview:</strong>Katherine uses fashion/shopping apps regularly, once or twice a week. She has has issues in the past using apps that have both an app and a website where functionality between the two are not very optimized. Another issues Katherine brought up was the lack of UI and useful features between the apps they have used. Katherine would be willing to try out an app which allows them to try on new clothes,  making shopping more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Katrina's interview:</strong>Katrina uses fashion/shopping apps a few times a month. They are relatively satisfied with their experience but like most people, has a hard time figuring out if the sizing options will fit them specifically. They are open to trying out a new service which allows them to see if the item will fit and is open to participating in a beta.</p>
