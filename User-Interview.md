<h1>Interviewee: Kira</h1>
1. What is your age?: I‚Äôm 21 y/o

2. Do you use apps on your phone?: I use them semi regularly

3. Have you ever used fashion/clothing related apps? ie. Poshmark, Grailed, RetailMeNot: I use Etsy & Poshmark semi regularly

4. How often do you use apps like these?: I use them semi regularly

5. What kind of apps do you use?: I usually use social media apps, but Etsy works too

6. How satisfied are you with shopping for clothing online?: I usually only shop online, so I‚Äôm pretty satisfied.

7. What kind of questions or difficulties have you had when doing this in the past?: Difficulties usually being that clothes don‚Äôt run true to size or end up being poor quality.

8. What worked well for you?: Worked well? Um, I usually go online to Kohl‚Äôs which has decent quality, or I use amazon lol

9. What would you most want to change about apps which allow you to see or buy clothing?: I kinda want to see pictures of actual people wear the clothes so I get an idea of how it looks in real life & not just a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù body

10. Would you be willing to use an app that allows you to try on clothes/outfits from home, using your camera without the need to go to the store?: Sounds kinda crazy, but I‚Äôm down for most things so maybe.

11. Would you be willing to sign-up for a beta once it were available?: I could be up to signing up for a beta‚Ä®



Thoughts on Kira's interview: Thoughts on the interview: Kira uses multiple fashion/clothing related apps. She‚Äôs experienced in online shopping and like most people, wonder what it would look like on a ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù versus a model. Potentially being open to the ability to try on clothing with their camera, that allows them to see what the piece of clothing or outfit may look like on them. Kira is open to joining a beta once it is available. This is my first interview, so I will give an overall take on all of my user interviews once I have completed them.




Interviewee: Cherish

1. What is your age?: 23 years old

2. Do you use apps on your phone?: Yes I do

3. Have you ever used fashion/clothing related apps? ie. Poshmark, Grailed, RetailMeNot: I have not

4. How often do you use apps like these?: Like never

5. What kind of apps do you use?: Mobile games and communication apps mostly

6. How satisfied are you with shopping for clothing online?: Pretty satisfied, though my staples tend to be oversized things so I'm an outlier

7. What kind of questions or difficulties have you had when doing this in the past?: "Will this ACTUALLY fit me?" when shopping for anything not oversized. And difficulties--the clothing not looking like I expected

8. What worked well for you?: Sticking to online for deliberately oversized garments and physical stores for everything else

9. What would you most want to change about apps which allow you to see or buy clothing?:  I don't have any useful input. I mean consistent sizing would be great, variety of body types in models, accurate photography, etc but I don't see these changes taking place anytime soon

10. Would you be willing to use an app that allows you to try on clothes/outfits from home, using your camera without the need to go to the store?: Actually yeah that would be neat

11. Would you be willing to sign-up for a beta once it were available?: Sure!

Thoughts on Cherish's interview:
Cherish doesn't use fashion/clothing apps but does find themselves purchasing clothes online often. Although she prefers to wear baggy clothing, so if something may not be accurate to size, it may not be an issue for them. Like other users, there are concerns of variety in clothing models photos. Often times, the models for the clothing aren't an average depiction of the average buyer. They would be opening to use an app to "try on clothes" and would be willing to sign up for our beta. I notice that knowing if the fit would be right on the user is an issue we likely cannot combat given our current and likely future features, this is something users want to know. Potentially, if this goes anywhere, we could possible give the ability for stores to add their products to our app or even implement it, in their sites. Giving accurate proprotions of the images we either mold to the user or "Resize". Potentially with the ability for users to pass in their measurements in a filter and find clothing that fits those measurements, even being able to be as specific as down to leg, hip, bust, and other measurements.



Interviewee: Jacob 
1. What is your age?: 21

2. Do you use apps on your phone?: Yes

3. Have you ever used fashion/clothing related apps? ie. Poshmark, Grailed, RetailMeNot: No

4. How often do you use apps like these?: Never

5. What kind of apps do you use?: N/A did not answer

6. How satisfied are you with shopping for clothing online?: 6/10

7. What kind of questions or difficulties have you had when doing this in the past?: do the clothes fit conventional sizes, shrinkage, quality of material. 

8. What worked well for you?: Amazon seems to work well and they offer a good return policy on clothing 

9. What would you most want to change about apps which allow you to see or buy clothing?:  See reviews specifically on the quality of the material, how it feels etc. I could care less how other customers like how it looks on them

10. Would you be willing to use an app that allows you to try on clothes/outfits from home, using your camera without the need to go to the store?: Yes

11. Would you be willing to sign-up for a beta once it were available?: Sure üôÇ

Thoughts on Jacob's interview: Jacob doesn't use any fashion/clothing apps. That being said, Jacob does purchase clothes online. It is unsure how often compared to conventional clothe shopping. Jacob seems to care more about the quality of a piece of clothing, moreso than how it may look or fit. Although fit is clearly a concern, especially if it will fit normal sizes well. Jacob has concerns with clothing not having enough reviews or information on how a product feels and the level of quality a product may be of. Jacob is open to joining a beta program for the app, although somebody like Jacob seems like less of a fit for our targeted demographic.
