# TryMe
Online shopping for clothes has been made simple with a virtual clone of yourself. See what matches and looks good to be in vogue! 

## Problem
Not knowing how the outfit will look overall when shopping online; spending too much time fitting clothes, taking it off trying to match the outfit.
## Solution
An app/website that will take in a picture of clothes and put it on userâ€™s 3d model (mannequin picture for MVP) and let the user see how it looks/matches.
